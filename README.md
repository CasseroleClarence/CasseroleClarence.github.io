# Hi there!

My name is Nick Santoso, and this is my personal website showcasing my experience, projects and whatever else I find cool. \
\
To give a bit of info about myself, I am a 4th year Biomedical Engineering Student at the University of British Columbia, specializing in Systems and Signals. Some of my skills include circuit and PCB design, soldering, and I dabble in embedded programming. My main academic interests are in medical device development, bionic prosthesis and biosignal processing. Outside of school and work, you can find me at the gym or in the kitchen as I love to cook! \
\
I hope you enjoy your time browsing and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would just like to chat!
