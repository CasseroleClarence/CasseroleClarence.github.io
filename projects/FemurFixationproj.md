# Fracture Fixation Plate Design

## Background and Overview
Our team developed a fracture fixation plate aimed at elderly women with femoral fractures, a group highly susceptible to osteoporosis-related complications. These patients require implants that allow immediate weight-bearing and minimize the risk of bending under load, while also supporting natural bone healing. Current fixation plates do not fully meet the needs of elderly patients, who often require increased support due to balance and bone density challenges.

Our project sought to design an implant that improves the stability, biocompatibility, and durability needed for long-term use in elderly patients. Collaborating with Dr. Pierre Guy, we designed a fracture fixation plate solution focused on addressing the specific biomechanical needs and recovery processes of this demographic.

## 1.0 Needs Assessment and Requirements
We identified and prioritized critical design requirements to ensure the implant met specific clinical needs:
- **Full Weight-Bearing Support**: Enables patients to bear weight on the affected limb early in recovery.
- **Minimally Invasive Procedure**: Designed for less bleeding and reduced anesthesia time, addressing age-related frailty.
- **Compact and Lightweight Design**: Fits comfortably alongside the femur with minimal interference.
- **Biocompatibility**: Made of materials resistant to rejection and degradation within the body.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Minimizes healthcare costs by reducing the need for frequent replacements or additional surgeries.

## 2.0 Concept Development
Our team generated and evaluated multiple design concepts, which included:
1. **Rod-Plate Combination**: An intramedullary rod paired with a small lateral locking plate to improve stability.
2. **Two Plates in Conjunction**: Plates applied to the lateral and medial sides of the femur for balanced support.
3. **Updated Intramedullary Nail**: A threaded rod to enhance fixation and stability.

After brainstorming and consulting with clinical experts, we selected the **Two Plates in Conjunction** design for its optimal stability and weight-bearing capabilities.

## 3.0 System Specifications and Final Design
The final design, modeled in CAD, comprises:
- **Titanium Alloy Plates**: High strength and biocompatibility for long-term stability.
- **Lateral and Medial Plate Configuration**: Reduces bending under load by distributing weight evenly across the femur.
- **Minimized Contact Area**: Ensures proper blood flow and reduces stress shielding, promoting natural bone healing.

### Surgical Procedure
Our design includes a proposed Less Invasive Stabilization System (LISS) approach to simplify the insertion of the plates, focusing on smaller incisions and optimized recovery.

## 4.0 Future Work and Testing
Future steps involve prototyping with titanium alloy models, testing under simulated loading conditions, and refining the bone model to improve accuracy for elderly patients. Additional testing on cadavers or models can further validate the designâ€™s effectiveness across different fracture severities and patient anatomies.
